# Rivers used as 'open sewers', says WWF charity

In August 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49131405) that river quality targets were "very unlikely" to be met in England. 

We analysed data on river water quality in England and along the Scottish and Welsh borders (the basin districts overseen by the Environment Agency).

It showed that by 2027 it's currently predicted that nearly three quarters of rivers will be "good" in terms of ecological status.

That compares with just 14% as of 2016, the latest current data available.

The WWF charity says it is "very unlikely" that this improvement will happen without new laws that will stop rivers being used, in their words, as "open sewers".

We combined each districtâ€™s data and then broke the figures down by overall waterbody for rivers before adding in the predictions for 2027.

The local data was also used to help regional broadcast colleagues find potential sites for filming.
