In August 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49131405) that river quality targets were "very unlikely" to be met in England. The story was the result of analysing data from the Environment Agency which had to be downloaded, combined and cleaned. 

## Get the data

* Environment Agency: [Catchment Data Explorer](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/)
* XLSX: [Raw data for river quality 2013-2016 and analysis](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/river-quality/blob/master/rivers_analysis.xlsx)
* XLSX: [Further rivers analysis](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/river-quality/blob/master/Rivers%20data%20-%20BBC%20England%20data%20unit.xlsx)

## Quotes and interviews

* Dave Tickner, chief freshwater adviser, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
